    "The operating system (OS) of a computer can organize your data files and folders, install and/or update Python interpreters, libraries/packages, and set up a Python environment exactly as you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interact with the OS on modern computers the starting point (once logged into your OS) is often a graphical user interface (GUI). But GUIs, as discussed in the lecture, offer relatively little control over the quasi-infinite number of instructions which an OS can receive. GUI instructions are also very manual, not easily reproducible, and can become obsolete when new versions of the OS GUI are released. In contrast, scripted instructions passed to a command line interface (CLI) are portable, automatable, timeless, and offer total control over your OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To access the CLI from your OS's GUI, you need to open a console (terminal window) which is an emulator of the so-called \"Shell\", a special type of program (an interpreter) which reads keyboard commands from the Unix (or Linux) language and passes them to the OS to carry out\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shell takes in alphanumeric symbols and transforms them into numeric (machine) instructions for the OS. The most common Shell is called BASH, which stands for Bourne Again SHell, in reference to Steve Bourne (not Jason:), the creator of the first Shell program called SH\n",
    "\n",
    "- All modern OS (Windows, Mac, Linux) come with a pre-installed Shell terminal emulator program\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are at least 100+ very useful Linux built in commands, each with its set of optional parameters. We will review a sample of ones I found most essential over the years, to show you the kind of interactions with the OS you can have when you (the programmer) send direct (scripted) commands to your OS\n",
