Occurences of Hallelujah:
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
